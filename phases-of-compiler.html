        What is a compiler?
        <UL>
          <LI> A recognizer (of some source language L).
          <LI> A translator (of programs written in L into programs written in some
               object or target language L').
        </UL>
        Here's a simple pictorial view:
        <pre>
            source program --> COMPILER --> object program
                                      |
                          --> error messages
        </pre>
        
        A compiler is <em>itself</em> a program, written in some <b>host</b>
        language.
        (In cs536, students will implement a compiler for a simple source language
        using Java as the host language.)
        
        <P>
        A compiler operates in <em>phases</em>;
        each phase translates the source program from one representation to
        another.  Different compilers may include different phases, and/or may
        order them somewhat differently.
        A typical organization is shown below.

              object program (might be assembly code or machine code)
        </pre>
        </UL>
        Below, we look at each phase of the compiler.
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Scanner</H1>
        <P>
        The scanner is called by the parser;
        here's how it works:
        <UL>
          <LI> The scanner reads characters from the source program.
          <LI> The scanner groups the characters into <b>lexemes</b> (sequences
               of characters that "go together").
          <LI> Each lexeme corresponds to a <b>token</b>; the scanner returns the next
               token (plus maybe some additional information) to the parser.
          <LI> The scanner may also discover lexical errors (e.g., erroneous
               characters).
        </UL>
        The definitions of what is a lexeme, token, or bad character all depend on
        the source language.
        
        <P>
        <b>Example</b>
        <P>
        Here are some Java lexemes and the corresponding tokens:
        <UL>
        <pre>
        lexeme:                 ;           =        index    tmp    37        102
        
        corresponding token:  SEMI-COLON   ASSIGN    IDENT  IDENT  INT-LIT  INT-LIT
        </pre>
        </UL>
        <P>
        Note that multiple lexemes can correspond to the same token (e.g., there are
        many identifiers).
        
        <P>
        Given the source code:
        <UL>
        <pre>
        position  =  initial +  rate   *    60 ;
        </pre>
        </UL>
        a Java scanner would return the following sequence of tokens:
        <UL>
        <pre>
        IDENT  ASSIGN IDENT PLUS IDENT TIMES INT-LIT SEMI-COLON
        </pre>
        </UL>
        
        Erroneous characters for Java source include # and control-a.
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Parser</H1>
        <P>
        The parser:
        <UL>
          <LI> Groups tokens into "grammatical phrases", discovering the underlying
               structure of the source program.
          <LI> Finds syntax errors.  For example, in Java the source code
               <UL><tt>position  =   *  5 ;</tt></UL>
               corresponds to the sequence of tokens:
               <UL><tt>IDENT ASSIGN TIMES INT-LIT SEMI-COLON</tt></UL>
               All are legal tokens, but that sequence of tokens is erroneous.
          <LI> Might find some "static semantic" errors, e.g., a use of an undeclared
               variable, or variables that are multiply declared.
          <LI> Might generate code, or build some intermediate representation of
               the program such as an abstract-syntax tree.
        </UL>
        <P>
        <b>Example</b>
        <UL>
        <pre>
        source code: position = initial + rate * 60 ;
        
        abstract-syntax tree:		=
                          /    \
                      position      +
                                   / \
                         initial  *
                                 / \
                          rate  60
        </pre>
        </UL>
        Notes:
        <UL>
          <LI> The interior nodes of the tree are <b>operators</b>.
          <LI> A node's children are its <b>operands</b>.
          <LI> Each subtree forms a "logical unit", e.g., the subtree with * at
               its root shows that because multiplication has higher precedence
               than addition, this operation must be performed as a unit (<em>not</em>
               initial+rate).
        </UL>
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Semantic Analyzer</H1>
        <P>
        The semantic analyzer checks for (more) "static semantic" errors,
        e.g., type errors.
        It may also annotate and/or change the abstract syntax tree (e.g., it
        might annotate each node that represents an expression with its type).
        </UL>
        <b>Example:</b>
        <pre>
                Abstract syntax tree before semantic analysis
        
                                   =
                                  / \
                                 /   \
                         position     +
                                     / \
                                    /   \
                             initial     *
                                        / \
                                       /   \
                                   rate     60
        
        
                Abstract syntax tree after semantic analysis
        
        
                                   = (float)
                                  / \
                                 /   \
                         position     + (float)
                         (float)     / \
                                    /   \
                             initial     * (float)
                             (float)    / \
                                       /   \
                                   rate     intToFloat (float)
                                                |
                                                |
                                                60 (int)
        </pre>
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Intermediate Code Generator</H1>
        <P>
        The intermediate code generator translates from abstract-syntax tree
        to intermediate code.
        One possibility is 3-address code (code in which each instruction
        involves at most 3 operands).
        Below is an example of 3-address code for the abstract-syntax tree
        shown above.
        Note that in this example, the first three instructions each have
        exactly three operands (the location where the result of the
        operation is stored, and two operators);
        the fourth instruction has just two operands ("position" and "temp3").
        <pre>
                temp1 = inttofloat(60)
                temp2 = rate * temp1
                temp3 = initial + temp2
                position = temp3
        </pre>
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Optimizer</H1>
        <P>
        The optimizer tries to improve code generated by the intermediate code
        generator.
        The goal is usually to make code run faster, but the optimizer may also
        try to make the code smaller.
        In the example above, an optimizer might first discover that the
        conversion of the integer 60 to a floating-point number can be done
        at compile time instead of at run time.
        Then it might discover that there is no need for "temp1" or "temp3".
        Here's the optimized code:
        <pre>
                temp2 = rate * 60.0
                position = initial + temp2
        </pre>
        
        <P>
        <H1>The Code Generator</H1>
        <P>
        The code generator generates object code from (optimized) intermediate code.
        For example, the following code might be generated for our running example:
        <pre>
        
                LOADF	rate,R1
                MULF	#60.0,R1
                LOADF	initial,R2
                ADDF	R2,R1
                STOREF	R1,position
        </pre>
